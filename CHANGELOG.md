# [1.1.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- Added an experimental 'Ignore Screen Notch' preference, which iOS users can enable to hopefully fix the display going to the middle of the screen.
  - I do not have an iOS device to test this though, so tell me if it works.
- In addition to that, 'Debug Display X Offset' has been added in case the preference above doesn't work very well.
- This CHANGELOG file to give users another way of checking out changes.

# [1.0.1] - 2026-01-04

### Changed

- Tweaked 'Debug Display' preference to use the game's save data instead of the mod's. No functional changes.
- Changed API version to 0.8.0 to make mod compatible with the LE SSERAFIM Collab Update.

# [1.0.0] - 2025-11-24

### Added

- Reimplemented the currently desktop only FPS Debug Display on mobile versions.
